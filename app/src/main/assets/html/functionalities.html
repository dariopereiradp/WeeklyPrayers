<h3>Functionalities</h3>
<li><strong>Prayer Requests</strong></li>
<p>
    - Each day of the week may have different subjects and different prayer requests. Click on a
    card and edit the content. The text is saved once you click on the back button.
</p>
<p>
    - You can get daily reminders to pray. You can enable it in the settings and choose a time to
    get the notifications. After that, you can click on the notification icon on the prayer cards to
    disable/enable a notification on a specific day of the week.
</p>
<p>
    - When you open a card or a notification, you can check the "Prayed" box to confirm that
    you prayed for it. When a new week begins, the checkboxes are reset. Here you can also change
    the color of the card and share the requests with other apps.
</p>
<li><strong> Journal</strong></li>
<p>
    - You can use the journal to save whatever you want. For exemple: ideas of gifts to give, a
    special poem and other things that you cannot forget.
</p>
<p>
    - You can also use it to add reminders. You can set a reminder by clicking on the bell icon and
    choosing a day and hour to get a notification.
</p>
<p>
    - You can search for a diary note using the search bar. The app will search for notes that match
    the text (not case sensitive) in the title or note text, including encrypted notes.
</p>
<p>
    - Once you open a note, it will be possible to change the note background. You can also
    share it with other apps by clicking on the share button.
</p>
<p>
    - You may want to write a secret thing. The app offers you the possibility to encrypt and
    decrypt your notes on the journal. It is possible to make multiple encryptions of the same text.
    Each encryption will be associated with a specific password, which may be different from the
    others. To decrypt, it will be necessary to enter the decryption passwords in the reverse order
    to which they were entered. Please, pay attention that it's not possible to recover any
    password. So be
    careful while using it to save important things. It's useful to write your passwords with the
    correct order in other places (physical support or other apps).
</p>
<p>
    - To delete a note, long press the note card and check every note you want to delete and click
    on the Delete option that will apear. Or you can just swipe left the note card and confirm that
    you want to delete.
</p>
<li><strong> About Her</strong></li>
<p>
    - Here you can save all the information about the person you love. You can add a picture by
    clicking on the picture icon and you can add all the other information by clicking on the Edit
    button.
</p>
<p>
    - A relationship is made by different stages. Each stage begins in a special day. The app lets
    you add different stages, adding a date and description to help you remember this day later. The
    first stage that the app automatically adds is the 'Day I met Her', but you are free to delete
    or modify it. To add/delete/edit stages, click on the Edit button.
</p>
<p>
    - You can set reminders for birthday and special days. You'll get the notification at midnight
    of that day.
</p>
<li><strong> Settings</strong></li>
<p>
    - Besides turning on daily prayer reminders, you can also change other settings. You can change
    your name and import your profile image from you Google account.
</p>
<p>
    - You can also choose a different language (at this moment, only English and Portuguese are
    supported).
</p>
<p>
    - You can switch the theme of the app between dark (better for reading and saving battery) and
    light mode. It's only supported on devices with Android 10+.
</p>
<li><strong> Google Backup and Restore</strong></li>
<p>
    - Click on Sign In button and choose your Google Account. Give the required permissions to
    import your name, email, profile picture and to have read and write access to your Google Drive
    account. The app can only read and access files generated by itself. Later you can sign-out of
    the app or disconnect account. The second action revokes all permissions given, but you can give
    them again later. The generated backup files are not deleted when you sign out or disconnect
    your account.
</p>
<p>
    - When you sign in, you can backup and restore databases and settings. A backup file named
    "dp.wkp.backup" will be created in a folder called "Pray for Her" at your Google Drive account
    root folder. The app will show you the date and time of the last backup. You should make regular
    backups to guarantee you don't loose any important data.
</p>
<p>
    - To restore a backup, the app will search your Google Drive account for a backup file. For
    better results, you should not move, delete or modify the file. When you restore a backup, all
    your data and settings are replaced and lost! It's recommended that you restore a backup
    before you start using your app in a new device. Please note that when you sign in in a new
    device (or after reinstalling the app), the app may not find the last backup date, but it
    doesn't mean that a backup file doesn't exists! You can try to restore anyway.
</p>
<li><strong> About the app</strong></li>
<p>
    - This app was created to remind us, men, to pray for our wives or future wives. I hope it can
    help us to fulfill our mission as spiritual leaders and priests of our homes. Listen to your
    wife and pray for her requests and for what you believe is important to make her more like
    Jesus. This app can help you remember everything that is important when you come before God and
    represent your wife. It's also useful to remember special days, so that you can celebrate with
    her what God has done in your lives. And finally, it's also useful to gather in one place most
    of the information about her, taking in count that a husband must be a student of his wife, that
    is, to learn everything about her, as the Bible says: "become one flesh" (Gen 2:24)
</p>
<p>
    <em>Remember: one of the most meaningful ways to show someone that you love them, is praying for
        them often! The more you pray and serve her, the more you love her!</em>
</p>
<p>
    - May God bless you using this app, and may it be a strong tool to strengthen your
    marriage/relationship! If you find an error or have any suggestions, don't hesitate to contact
    us!
</p>

<p>
    - About encryption: in this version the app uses AES Encryption Algorithm with ECB encryption
    mode, which is not safe at all. It may be possible to decrypt a note without password if
    someone has access to the database file where notes are stored. But only people with some
    level of knowledge in cryptographic algorithms will be able to do it, and it's not an easy task.
    However, to increase the safety of an important note, make multiple encryptions with different
    passwords and keep the backup file in Google Drive safe. But for normal daily use and if you
    only deal with "average" people, don't worry about that!
</p>
<p>
    - About data protection: DPSoft doesn't use or have any server. All your personal data and
    settings remain on your own device and your own Google Drive account (via auto-backup
    from Android and manual backup you do when you grant necessary permissions). DPSoft doesn't
    have access to any of your data! Pay attention that in the current version your data is not
    encrypted
    (except the notes you encrypted, that are stored in plain encrypted text) so, the security of
    your information depends on you and the protection mechanisms of Google and Android.
